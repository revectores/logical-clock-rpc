This project implemented three types of logical clocks introduced by [Why Logical Clocks are Easy](https://github.com/revectores/logical-clock-rpc/blob/main/docs/Why%20Logical%20Clocks%20are%20Easy.pdf):

- **Casual Histories**
- **Vector Clock**
- **Version Vector**

A concise notes summarizing the three methods is provided [here](https://github.com/revectores/logical-clock-rpc/blob/main/docs/Why%20Logical%20Clocks%20are%20Easy%20Notes.pdf).



Refer to [Vector Clock Implementation Based on RPC](https://github.com/revectores/logical-clock-rpc/blob/main/docs/Vector%20Clock%20Implementation%20Based%20on%20RPC.md) for more details about the design and structure of this project.
