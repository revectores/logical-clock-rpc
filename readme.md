This project implemented three types of logical clocks introduced by [Why Logical Clocks are Easy](docs/Why Logical Clocks are Easy.pdf):

- **Casual Histories**
- **Vector Clock**
- **Version Vector**

A concise notes summarizing the three methods is provided [here](docs/Why Logical Clocks are Easy Notes.pdf).

Refer to [Vector Clock Implementation Based on RPC](docs/Vector Clock Implementation Based on RPC.pdf) for more details about the design and structure of this project.
